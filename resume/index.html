                        Developed a Custom AI Assistant for the company which 
                        involved implementations of real-time speech-to-text 
                        using Whisper, natural language processing supported 
                        by spacy and jieba, and text-to-speech functionalities. 
                        Enabled interaction in English, Chinese, and both, with 
                        dynamic role-switching and personalized responses with 
                        file search capabilities using both local files and vector 
                        stores. Direct text input and txt file uploading for prompt 
                        are supported.

                        Real-Time Lipsyncing: The audio streaming via gRPC enables 
                        the interactive response to NVIDIA Audio2Face for real-time 
                        lipsyncing and facial performances.

                        (GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5, and Groq with llama3) are integrated 
                        for flexibility and their response time are plotted under 
                        various configurations for performance benchmarking.
